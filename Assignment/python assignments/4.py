# Write a Python program to demonstrate the creation of variables and different data types.
# • Practical Example 1: How does the Python code structure work?
"""
python code typically starts at the top and executes sequentially
Indentation is crucial for defining block of code
"""

# • Practical Example 2: How to create variables in Python?

name = "Dip" #String variables
age = 25 #Integer variable
hight = 5.9 # Float variable
is_student = True #Boolean variable

print("Name : ",name)
print("Age : ",age)
print("Hight : ",hight)
print("Is student : ",is_student)
# • Practical Example 3: How to take user input using the input() function.

number = int(input("number = "))

# • Practical Example 4: How to check the type of a variable dynamically using type().

print(type(name))
print(type(age))
print(type(hight))
print(type(is_student))
print(type(number))
