# Write a Python program that demonstrates the correct use of indentation, comments, and variables following PEP 8 guidelines.

# Indentation: Consistent 4-space indentation is used throughout the code

age = 25
if age>20 : # if the age is bigger than 20 the output is print onlt if condition 
    print("You are eligible for playing match as you are {} year old".format(age))

else : # and the age is less then 20 the output will print the else condition
    print("You are not eligible for playing match as you are {} year old".format(age))

print("Hello Good morning")

# Comments: Comments are used to explain the code's purpose, and inline comments are used sparingly
# there are 2 type of comment you can use first is # and second is for multiple line --> """ """


# Variable : Variables are used to store data values. Unlike some other programming languages, Python has no explicit command 
# for declaring a variable; it is created the moment a value is assigned to it. The type of the variable is determined by the value 
# assigned to it and can be changed during the program execution.
